# Superpowers

Superpowers is a complete software development workflow for your coding agents, built on top of a set of composable "skills" and some initial instructions that make sure your agent uses them.

## How it works

It starts from the moment you fire up your coding agent. As soon as it sees that you're building something, it *doesn't* just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do. 

Once it's teased a spec out of the conversation, it shows it to you in chunks short enough to actually read and digest. 

After you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan that's clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow. It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY. 

Next up, once you say "go", it launches a *subagent-driven-development* process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for Claude to be able to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.

There's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special. Your coding agent just has Superpowers.


## Sponsorship

If Superpowers has helped you do stuff that makes money and you are so inclined, I'd greatly appreciate it if you'd consider [sponsoring my opensource work](https://github.com/sponsors/obra).

Thanks!

## Installation

**Note:** Installation differs by platform. Claude Code has a built-in plugin system. Codex and OpenCode require manual setup.

### Claude Code (via Plugin Marketplace)

In Claude Code, register the marketplace first:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
```

Then install the plugin from this marketplace:

```bash
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

### Verify Installation

Check that skills appear:

```bash
/help
```

```
# Should see skills like:
# /superpowers:brainstorming - Interactive design refinement
# /superpowers:collab - Design-to-implementation pipeline
# /superpowers:writing-plans - Create implementation plan
```

### Codex

Tell Codex:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md
```

**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.codex.md](docs/README.codex.md)

### OpenCode

Tell OpenCode:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md
```

**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.opencode.md](docs/README.opencode.md)

## The Basic Workflow

**Start with brainstorming** (automatic) or use `/collab` for full design-to-implementation tracking with state persistence.

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, presents design in sections for validation. Saves design document.

2. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.

3. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into bite-sized tasks. Every task has exact file paths, complete code, verification steps.

4. **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** - Activates with plan. Dispatches fresh subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality), or executes in batches with human checkpoints.

5. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit.

6. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Reviews against plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.

7. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when tasks complete. Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard), cleans up worktree.

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.

## Collab Workflow

For complex features that need structured design-to-implementation flow, use the **collab workflow**. Start with `/collab` to create an isolated design session.

```
/collab → brainstorming → rough-draft → implementation → cleanup
```

### How It Works

1. **Start a collab** - Run `/collab`, pick a template (feature, bugfix, refactor, spike), get an auto-generated session name
2. **Brainstorm** - Create a live design document with goals, decisions, diagrams, and success criteria
3. **Rough-draft** - Progress through 4 phases: interfaces → pseudocode → skeleton → implementation handoff
4. **Verification gates** - At each phase transition, compare artifacts against design and catch drift early
5. **Execute** - Tasks run respecting dependency graph (parallel when safe, sequential when required)
6. **Cleanup** - Artifacts archived to `docs/designs/<name>/`, collab folder removed

### Key Features

- **Context persistence** - State survives across conversations in `.collab/<name>/`
- **Design drift detection** - Automatic comparison catches deviations before they compound
- **Task dependencies** - YAML task graph with Mermaid visualization
- **Multi-collab support** - Run multiple design sessions simultaneously
- **Templates** - Pre-configured workflows for features, bugfixes, refactors, and spikes

### Quick Start

```
You: /collab
Agent: What type of work? [feature/bugfix/refactor/spike]
You: feature
Agent: Created collab "bright-calm-river". Starting brainstorming...
```

Resume anytime with `/collab` and select the existing session.
