# ⚠️ This Repository Has Moved

**Superpowers Collab has been merged into [claude-mermaid-collab](https://github.com/ben-mad-jlp/claude-mermaid-collab).**

## New Installation

```bash
/plugin install ben-mad-jlp/claude-mermaid-collab
```

The combined repository includes:
- All skills (brainstorming, collab, writing-plans, TDD, debugging, etc.)
- The mermaid-collab diagram server
- MCP integration for Claude Code

## Why the merge?

The skills and the diagram server were always meant to work together. Combining them into a single plugin simplifies installation and ensures compatibility.
